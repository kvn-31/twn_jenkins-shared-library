# Jenkins Shared Library

This project is used for demo purposes. It is a Jenkins shared library that is used by the [Java Maven App - jenkins shared library](https://github.com/kvn-31/twn_java-maven-app/tree/jenkins-shared-lib) repository.

It contains the logic to build a maven application an push to a private docker hub repository. 
Partly, the logic is extracted to src/com.example/Docker.
